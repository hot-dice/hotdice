        <p>Hot Dice has 2 scores to track, the running score and total score.</p>
        <p>A player rolls 6 dice to start and must retain at least 1 scoring die per roll. They may end their turn any time and transfer their running score to the total score or continue to roll their remaining dice, BUT</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If no scoring dice are ever rolled, the player BUSTS, ending their turn and losing their running score.</li>
          <li>If all dice score, the player has HOT DICE! and gets to roll all 6 dice again while maintaining their running score.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This process is repeated until a playerâ€™s total score is 10,000.</p>
